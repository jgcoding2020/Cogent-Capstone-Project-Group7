    In order to make the home screen's bg image fit the whole screen.
    You need to have every HTML component leading up to the image have
    a height and width of 100%, as well as give the app-root component
    the property of "display: block." By default, custom HTML components 
    are styled as "display: inline", which do ont fully respect height 
    and width properties.
